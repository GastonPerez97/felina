							Breaking Bad follows protagonist Walter White (Bryan
							Cranston), a chemistry teacher who lives in New
							Mexico with his wife (Anna Gunn) and teenage son (RJ
							Mitte) who has cerebral palsy. White is diagnosed
							with Stage III cancer and given a prognosis of two
							years left to live.
						</Text>

						<Text>
							With a new sense of fearlessness based on his
							medical prognosis, and a desire to secure his
							family's financial security, White chooses to enter
							a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to
							power in the world. The series explores how a fatal
							diagnosis such as White's releases a typical man
							from the daily concerns and constraints of normal
							society and follows his transformation from mild
							family man to a kingpin of the drug trade.
